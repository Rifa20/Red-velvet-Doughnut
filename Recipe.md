Steps
Red Velvet Doughnuts

1.Place the yeast, warm water and 1 tsp granulated sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Allow this to sit for 10 minutes, until the yeast begins to develop.

2.Add the flour, ¼ cup sugar, eggs, red food coloring, butter and salt. Set the mixer to medium speed and knead for 8-9 minutes, until the dough is smooth, soft and bounces back when poked with your finger.

3.Add the mini chocolate chips and knead until incorporated. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

4.Roll the dough out to ¼ inch-thick and cut into 2 ½ inch-wide circles with a cookie cutter. You should be able to get 15-20 doughnuts.

5.Transfer the doughnuts to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot and let rise for 20 minutes.

6.Pour about 5 inches of canola oil into a pot and set to medium heat. Attach a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil to 370F. Fry 3 or 4 doughnuts at a time, cooking for 1 minuteon each side or until golden.

7.Remove the doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towel. Cool completely.

8.Poke holes into the sides of the doughnuts with a knife. Fill the doughnuts with the filling.
Dunk the doughnuts into the glaze, then place on a wire rack. Allow the glaze to set and enjoy!
